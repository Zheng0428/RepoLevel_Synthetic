    Given three examples of bugs introduced to Python code and a target Python code snippet, generate a new bug that follows similar patterns of realistic programming errors along with a comprehensive unittest file that can detect this bug.

    ## Bug Example 1:
    **Problem Statement:** {example_problem_statement_1}
    
    **Modified Files:**
    {example_buggy_files_1}

    ## Bug Example 2:
    **Problem Statement:** {example_problem_statement_2}
    
    **Modified Files:**
    {example_buggy_files_2}

    ## Bug Example 3:
    **Problem Statement:** {example_problem_statement_3}
    
    **Modified Files:**
    {example_buggy_files_3}

    ## Target Code (Original Clean Code):
    
    ### Main Script:
    {main_script_code}
    
    ### Dependencies Scripts:
    {dependencies_script_code}

    ## Task:
    Based on the bug patterns shown in the examples above, generate a NEW bug and corresponding unittest that:
    1. **MUST be introduced into the Target Code above** (primarily focused on the Main Script, but can also involve Dependencies Scripts if needed)
    2. Is different from all three examples but follows similar realistic programming error patterns
    3. Would be something a developer might accidentally introduce
    4. Maintains the overall structure and functionality of the original code
    5. **Should be DIFFICULT and SUBTLE** - requiring deep understanding of the code logic, careful debugging skills, and thorough analysis to identify and fix
    6. Should not cause obvious syntax errors or immediate crashes, but rather introduce logical errors that manifest under specific conditions
    7. **Must be accompanied by a comprehensive unittest** that thoroughly tests the functionality and can detect the introduced bug

    ## Output Requirements:
    - Provide COMPLETE buggy code for each modified file (not partial snippets)
    - Provide a COMPLETE unittest file that tests the functionality and detects the bug
    - The unittest should pass when testing the original clean code but fail when testing the buggy code
    - Follow the exact output format below for easy parsing
    - **GENERATE EXTENSIVE TEST CASES**: Create at least 8-12 individual test methods to ensure comprehensive coverage

    ## Output Format:
    ===PROBLEM_STATEMENT_START===
    [Describe the bug as a GitHub issue in the same format as the three examples above - focus on what's wrong, the symptoms, and impact. Keep it concise and user-focused without technical implementation details.]
    ===PROBLEM_STATEMENT_END===

    ===BUG_ANALYSIS_START===
    **Test Detection Analysis:**
    - Which specific test methods/cases in the generated unittest will detect this bug
    - Why the bug causes those particular tests to fail
    - Under what conditions the bug manifests
    - Expected vs actual behavior that causes test failures

    **Bug Characteristics:**
    - Type of programming error introduced
    - Why this bug is subtle and difficult to detect through code review
    - What makes this bug realistic (common developer mistakes)

    **Unittest Design:**
    - Key test scenarios covered by the unittest
    - How the unittest comprehensively validates the functionality
    - Specific test cases designed to catch the introduced bug
    - Description of pass-to-pass test cases that verify core functionality remains intact
    ===BUG_ANALYSIS_END===

    ===BUGGY_FILES_START===
    ===FILE_START===
    FILE_PATH: [exact file path of the main script]
    ===CODE_START===
    ```python
    [complete buggy code for the main script - must be the full file content, not snippets]
    ```
    ===CODE_END===
    ===FILE_END===

    [Include for each modified dependencies script]
    ===FILE_START===
    FILE_PATH: [exact file path of dependencies script]
    ===CODE_START===
    ```python
    [complete buggy code for dependencies script - only if changes are needed]
    ```
    ===CODE_END===
    ===FILE_END===

    ===BUGGY_FILES_END===

    ===UNITTEST_FILE_START===
    FILE_PATH: [unittest file path, e.g., test_[module_name].py]
    ===CODE_START===
    ```python
    [complete unittest code that thoroughly tests the functionality and can detect the introduced bug]
    ```
    ===CODE_END===
    ===UNITTEST_FILE_END===

    ## Critical Requirements:
    1. **Bug Difficulty**: The bug must be HARD to detect and fix, involving:
       - Subtle logical errors that only manifest under specific conditions
       - Edge cases that are easily overlooked
       - Complex interactions between different parts of the code
       - Issues that require deep understanding of the algorithm or data flow

    2. **Unittest Quality**: The generated unittest must:
       - **PASS ALL TESTS** when testing the original clean code
       - **FAIL SPECIFIC TESTS** when testing the buggy code
       - **GENERATE AT LEAST 8-12 TEST METHODS** for comprehensive coverage
       - Include extensive edge cases and boundary conditions
       - Use appropriate test methods (assertEqual, assertTrue, assertRaises, etc.)
       - Follow proper unittest structure with setUp/tearDown if needed
       - Include descriptive test method names and docstrings
       - Test both normal functionality and error conditions
       - **Include pass-to-pass test cases** that verify core functionality works correctly in both buggy and clean versions

    3. **Problem Statement Style**: Write the problem statement like a GitHub issue:
       - Focus on user-visible symptoms and impact
       - Describe what's broken from a user perspective
       - Avoid implementation details or technical jargon
       - Be concise but clear about the problem

    4. **Test Design Strategy**: The unittest should:
       - **Create COMPREHENSIVE test coverage** with multiple test methods
       - Include specific test cases that will catch the introduced bug (fail-to-pass cases)
       - Include test cases that should pass in both versions (pass-to-pass cases)
       - Test edge cases and boundary conditions extensively
       - Validate both successful operations and error handling
       - Use meaningful assertions that clearly indicate what went wrong
       - **Target minimum 10-15 individual test methods** covering different aspects of functionality

    5. **Test Case Distribution**:
       - **Bug-detecting tests (fail-to-pass)**: 3-5 test methods that fail with the bug but pass with clean code
       - **Core functionality tests (pass-to-pass)**: 5-12 test methods that should pass regardless of the bug to ensure other functionality is preserved
       - Include tests for normal use cases, edge cases, error conditions, and integration scenarios

    ## Important Notes:
    - All code must be wrapped in ```python blocks for proper syntax highlighting
    - Follow the exact delimiters (===SECTION_START===, ===SECTION_END===) for parsing
    - The bug must be introduced to the Target Code, not the example codes
    - Focus on creating sophisticated bugs that challenge debugging skills rather than obvious errors
    - The unittest should be production-quality with proper structure, documentation, and coverage
    - Ensure the unittest is self-contained and can be run independently
    - **EMPHASIZE QUANTITY**: Generate extensive test methods to ensure comprehensive validation
    - The bug should be subtle enough that it might pass casual inspection but will be caught by thorough testing
    - Include both specific bug-detection tests and general functionality preservation tests
    - **Main Script is the primary focus**, but Dependencies Scripts can be modified if the bug logic requires it
    - Dependencies Scripts may be empty if no dependencies exist
    - **Support multiple dependencies scripts** - include all relevant files that need modification
